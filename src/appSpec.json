  "initialPrompt": "a site for pet owners to interact live with other pet owners. They have to create an account with their pet's name and age. Each type of pet owner has their own type of community. Each pet owner should interact freely with other pet owners. It should be just like social media. It should also have a live connect with nearby vets to get online checkups or emergency consultation. It should also have a page on the pets' behavioral problems. Each pet owner's location should be seen in a place called 'pet map'. The site should also have a gallery to store the pics with captions and be able to follow other pet owners of all types. Make it owner_pet friendly.",
